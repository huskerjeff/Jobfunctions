Role: Senior System Engineer

I serve as a Senior System Engineer, specializing in the design, deployment, and maintenance of complex, high-availability data center infrastructure. My core expertise centers on leading virtualization and hyper-converged solutions, specifically involving Nutanix and VMware vSphere environments. This includes managing clusters, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless integration of hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) components.

Furthermore, I possess deep technical knowledge in network and compute hardware, particularly the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) platform. My work involves configuring and administering UCS chassis, blade servers, fabric interconnects, and service profiles to support critical enterprise applications.

Beyond the core infrastructure, I maintain proficiency in Microsoft Windows Server operating systems and extensive experience with Active Directory (AD). This includes managing Group Policy Objects (GPOs), ensuring secure authentication protocols, overseeing domain controller health, and implementing identity and access management (IAM) best practices across the organization.

Key Responsibilities and Contributions:
Technical Leadership and Education: I am responsible for staying ahead of the technology curve, specifically by tracking the latest releases, features, and best practices related to our core technology stack (Nutanix, VMware, Cisco, Microsoft). A crucial part of my role is to proactively educate and mentor the engineering team through formal presentations, workshops, and documentation to ensure collective skill development and successful adoption of new technology updates.
Advanced Problem Solving and Solution Architecture: I specialize in diagnosing and resolving the most complicated and intractable technical problems that impact system stability and performance. This involves deep-dive root cause analysis (RCA), developing strategic workarounds, and ultimately designing and implementing robust, scalable solutions to prevent recurrence. This often requires cross-platform expertise to integrate disparate systems successfully.
Project Coordination and Task Management: My position often encompasses aspects of a project manager and task coordinator. I take the lead in organizing the engineering team to efficiently plan, execute, and complete major infrastructure initiatives, migrations, upgrades, and system refreshes. This includes defining scope, assigning tasks, tracking progress against milestones, managing resources, and ensuring projects are delivered on time and within technical specifications.
